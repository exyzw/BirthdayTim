					<p> Happy birthday Tim, i hope you have an amazing year and get to your millionaire goal of course. I will use this opportunity to remind you again of how much i appreciate you. You have helped me tremendously through many periods of my life for the time we have known each other and I have learned so much from you. You are an amazing and a very funny person really, im very lucky to have met you and i hope we can really meet someday and I can try your salmon pasta. The way you fix my mood even after terrible days by just talking is something I'm still appalled by. I'm not sure how you view our relationship but I do know how important you are to me. Well I hope you at least feel somewhat similar about me, even though I'm not so knowledgable and helpful for you, I think I did a pretty good job with my teapot lesson. And most important of all, I love you VERY much, even if it's going too far, I'd rather be honest about it.</p>
